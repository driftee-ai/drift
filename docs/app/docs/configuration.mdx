# Configuration

The `.drift.yaml` file defines the rules for checking drift.

## Top-Level Fields

- **`version`** (required): The version of the configuration file format. Currently, this should be `1`.
- **`provider`** (required): The backend provider to use for assessing drift. Currently supported providers are:
    - `"gemini"`: Uses the Google Gemini API. Requires the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    - `"openai"`: 🚧 Coming Soon! Support for OpenAI models.
- **`rules`** (required): A list of rules to check.

## Rule Fields

- **`name`** (required): A descriptive name for the rule.
- **`code`** (required): A list of glob patterns for the code files.
- **`docs`** (required): A list of glob patterns for the documentation files.

### Glob Patterns

Glob patterns are used to specify file paths using wildcards. For example:
- `*.go`: Matches all Go files in the current directory.
- `src/**/*.go`: Matches all Go files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories.
- `docs/api/*.md`: Matches all Markdown files in the `docs/api` directory.

## Example `.drift.yaml`

```yaml
version: 1
provider: gemini
rules:
  - name: "User API Documentation"
    code:
      - "src/api/user.go"
    docs:
      - "docs/api/users.md"
  - name: "Authentication Service"
    code:
      - "src/auth/**/*.go"
    docs:
      - "docs/auth.md"
```
