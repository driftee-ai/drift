# Usage

The `drift` CLI has two main commands: `init` and `check`.

## `drift init`

This command initializes a new project by creating a `.drift.yaml` configuration file in the current directory.

```bash
drift init
```

This will create a `.drift.yaml` file with some example configuration to get you started.

## `drift check`

This command checks for drift between your code and documentation based on the rules in your `.drift.yaml` file.

To check all files:

```bash
drift check
```

You can also use a custom configuration file with the `--config` flag:

```bash
drift check --config /path/to/your/config.yaml
```

The `drift check` command evaluates your code and documentation against the `rules` defined in your `.drift.yaml` configuration file. Each rule specifies a set of code files and corresponding documentation files to be assessed for consistency.

If `drift` detects any discrepancies, it will report them and exit with a non-zero exit code, making it easy to integrate into your CI/CD pipeline. The assessment is performed by an AI model (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI) which analyzes the content and provides a reason for any detected drift.

### Example Output

Here's an example of what you might see if drift is detected:

```
Loaded 1 rules from .drift.yaml (provider: gemini)
  - Rule: User API Documentation
    Found 1 code files, total size: 1234 bytes
    Found 1 doc files, total size: 567 bytes
    Result: Out of Sync (Reason: The `GetUser` function in `user.go` now includes a `context.Context` parameter, which is not reflected in the `users.md` documentation.)
drift detected
```

For more details on configuring your `rules` and LLM providers, refer to the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.mdx).

## CI/CD Integration

`drift` is designed to be a part of your CI/CD pipeline, helping you catch documentation drift before it gets merged.

### GitHub Action

We provide an official [GitHub Action](https://github.com/driftee-ai/drift/tree/main/actions/drift-check) to make this integration seamless.

By adding a simple step to your workflow, you can automatically run `drift check` on every pull request. The action will fail if drift is detected, preventing the pull request from being merged until the documentation is back in sync.

For detailed setup instructions, please see the [action's README](https://github.com/driftee-ai/drift/tree/main/actions/drift-check).
