# Introduction

Drift is a command-line tool to detect and prevent drift between your code and your documentation.
It uses large language models to assess if your documentation accurately reflects your code.

## Why Drift?

Testing

Keeping documentation in sync with a rapidly evolving codebase is a common challenge.
Drift helps automate this process by leveraging the power of LLMs to understand the semantics of your code and documentation, and identify discrepancies.

This tool is particularly useful for ensuring that your API documentation accurately reflects the implementation of your API.

## Key Features

- **LLM-Powered Assessment:** Drift uses large language models to perform a semantic comparison between your code and documentation.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Define rules in a simple YAML file to specify which code and documentation files to compare.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Easily integrate Drift into your CI/CD pipeline to catch documentation drift before it becomes a problem.
- **Multiple Provider Support:** Drift supports multiple LLM providers, with Gemini being the first.
