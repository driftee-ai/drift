# Installation

The `drift` CLI is distributed as a Docker image, making it easy to integrate into your CI/CD pipelines.

## Docker Installation

To install and run the `drift` CLI, follow these steps:

1.  **Pull the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/driftee-ai/agent:latest
    ```

2.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    The `drift` CLI requires an API key for authentication. Set the `DRIFTEE_API_KEY` environment variable with your key.
    ```bash
    export DRIFTEE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
    In a CI/CD environment, you should configure this as a secret.

3.  **Run the `drift` Agent:**
    You can run the `drift` CLI using the Docker image. For example, to run a `check` command:
    ```bash
    docker run ghcr.io/driftee-ai/agent:latest drift check
    ```
    Ensure that your project's `.drift.yaml` file and relevant code/documentation are accessible within the Docker container (e.g., by mounting volumes).
