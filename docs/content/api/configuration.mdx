# Configuration

The `drift` tool is configured using a `.drift.yaml` file in the root of your project.

### `version`
The version of the configuration file format. Currently, this should be `1`.

### `mappings`
A list of mappings between your code and your documentation. Each mapping has two properties:

- `code`: The path to a source code file.
- `docs`: The path to a documentation file.

**Example:**
```yaml
version: 1
mappings:
  - code: src/api/user.go
    docs: docs/api/users.md
  - code: src/api/auth.go
    docs: docs/api/authentication.md
```
