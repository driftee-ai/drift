# `drift check`

This command checks for drift between your code and documentation based on the rules in your `.drift.yaml` file.

To check all files:

```bash
drift check
```

You can also use a custom configuration file with the `--config` flag:

```bash
drift check --config /path/to/your/config.yaml
```

### Checking Changed Files

For faster checks, especially in a CI/CD environment, you can check only the files that have been modified. The `--changed-files` flag (or `-f`) allows you to pass a list of file paths to check against.

`drift` will then compare this list of files against the glob patterns in your rules and only run the assessments for the rules that are "triggered" by a matching file.

```bash
# Pass a specific list of files
drift check --changed-files "pkg/server/main.go,docs/api/server.md"
```

This is most powerful when combined with `git` to automatically check files in a pull request:

```bash
# Get a list of changed files from git and pass them to drift
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | tr '\n' ',')
drift check --changed-files "$CHANGED_FILES"
```

The `drift check` command evaluates your code and documentation against the `rules` defined in your `.drift.yaml` configuration file. Each rule specifies a set of code files and corresponding documentation files to be assessed for consistency.

If `drift` detects any discrepancies, it will report them and exit with a non-zero exit code, making it easy to integrate into your CI/CD pipeline. The assessment is performed by an AI model (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI) which analyzes the content and provides a reason for any detected drift.

### Example Output

Here's an example of what you might see if drift is detected:

```
Loaded 1 rules from .drift.yaml (provider: gemini)
  - Rule: User API Documentation
    Found 1 code files, total size: 1234 bytes
    Found 1 doc files, total size: 567 bytes
    Result: Out of Sync (Reason: The `GetUser` function in `user.go` now includes a `context.Context` parameter, which is not reflected in the `users.md` documentation.)
drift detected
```

For more details on configuring your `rules` and LLM providers, refer to the [Configuration Guide](../../configuration.mdx).
