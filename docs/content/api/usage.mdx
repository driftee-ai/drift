# Usage

The `drift` CLI has two main commands: `init` and `check`.

## `drift init`

The `init` command creates a scaffold `.drift.yaml` file in your current directory. You can then edit this file to configure your code and documentation mappings.

```bash
drift init
```

## `drift check`

The `check` command is the core of the tool. It analyzes the files specified in your `.drift.yaml` and reports any drift between your code and your documentation.

```bash
drift check
```

If any drift is detected, the command will exit with a non-zero exit code and print a report of the issues it found.
