# Usage

The `drift` CLI has two main commands: `init` and `check`.

## `drift init`

This command initializes a new project by creating a `.drift.yaml` configuration file in the current directory.

```bash
drift init
```

This will create a `.drift.yaml` file with some example configuration to get you started.

## `drift check`

This command checks for drift between your code and documentation based on the rules in your `.drift.yaml` file.

To check all files:

```bash
drift check
```

You can also use a custom configuration file with the `--config` flag:

```bash
drift check --config /path/to/your/config.yaml
```

If `drift` detects any discrepancies, it will report them and exit with a non-zero exit code, making it easy to integrate into your CI/CD pipeline.
