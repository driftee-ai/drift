# CI/CD Integration

`drift` is designed to be a part of your CI/CD pipeline, helping you catch documentation drift before it gets merged.

### GitHub Action

We provide an official [GitHub Action](https://github.com/driftee-ai/drift/tree/main/actions/drift-check) to make this integration seamless.

By adding a simple step to your workflow, you can automatically run `drift check` on every pull request. The action will fail if drift is detected, preventing the pull request from being merged until the documentation is back in sync.

For detailed setup instructions, please see the [action's README](https://github.com/driftee-ai/drift/tree/main/actions/drift-check).
